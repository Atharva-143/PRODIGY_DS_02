### Task-02: Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Internship: Data Science Internship – Prodigy InfoTech

---

### Objective
To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset in order to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends related to passenger survival.

---

### Dataset
Source: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)  
Description: The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic details, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

---

### Data Cleaning Steps
- Identified missing values in the dataset.
- Dropped the Cabin column due to a high number of missing values.
- Filled missing values in the Age column using the median.
- Filled missing values in the Embarked column using the mode.
- Ensured the dataset had no remaining missing values.

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed to explore relationships and patterns in the data:

1. Survival Count  
   Analyzed the overall distribution of survivors and non-survivors.

2. Survival Rate by Gender  
   Compared survival rates between male and female passengers.

3. Survival Rate by Passenger Class  
   Examined how passenger class influenced survival chances.

4. Age Distribution of Survivors vs Non-Survivors  
   Compared age distributions to understand the impact of age on survival.

---

### Key Insights
- A larger number of passengers did not survive the disaster.
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than male passengers.
- Passengers traveling in higher classes had better survival chances.
- Younger passengers, especially children, showed relatively higher survival rates.

---

### Conclusion
This task demonstrates effective data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using a real-world dataset. The analysis highlights how factors such as gender, passenger class, and age influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster.
